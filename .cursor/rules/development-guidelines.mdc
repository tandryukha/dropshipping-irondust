Development guidelines
- change is made
- javadocs are addeed (wherever makes sense)
- server docker-compose restarted (consider using @rebuild-and-watch.sh)
- verified e2e with curl if possible (please don't run full injest with AI due to cost)
- woo and local api server can be checked for troubleshooting
- if API changed/extended: postman collection updated
- /docs is up-to-date
- don't change UI if not asked


Out of scope (for now):
- test coverage

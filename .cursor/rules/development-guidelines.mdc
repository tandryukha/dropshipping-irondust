Development guidelines
- change is made
- javadocs are addeed (wherever makes sense)
- server docker-compose restarted (consider using @rebuild-and-watch.sh)
- verified e2e with curl if possible (please don't run full injest with AI due to cost)
- woo and local api server can be checked for troubleshooting
- if API changed/extended: postman collection updated
- /docs is up-to-date
- don't change UI if not asked
- if asked to fix an issue: prefer to write unit test based on real data (fetch woo and/or API if needed), run it to reproduce the issue, then apply the fix and rerun the tests
- After unit tests confirm the fix: run @rebuild-and-watch.sh in the background and run a curl to reingest some typical items to see if the issue is fixed E2E (issues with ingest). 
- make sure you don't wait forever for the terminal output, set timeouts


Out of scope (for now):
- test coverage
